# Vehicle-Cruise-control
This first order system uses a proportional Integral control to come up with the gas 
pedal values (in percentage) in order to reach the given set point and 
also respond to the change in set point. 
Kc is the proportional gain and tauI is the Integral time constant. So the integral gain is Kc/tauI.
Also instead of givng the input to the gas pedal the input can be given to the Induction motor of an electric car
through a vfd to increase of decrease the velocity of the vehicle.
